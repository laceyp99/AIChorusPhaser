This audio plugin project was created to showcase the use of Phaser and Chorus audio effects in a single plugin. The plugin includes both the Phaser and Chorus effects, and it dynamically switches between them based on the selection made in the ComboBox.

The project was inspired by the responses of ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. It demonstrates the effectiveness of AI in providing guidance and ideas for coding projects.

**Requirements**

To use this audio plugin, you will need a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) that supports VST, VST3, or AU plugin formats. The plugin was built and tested on Windows, but should also work on Mac and Linux systems.

**Installation**

To install the plugin, simply take the source files and replace them in your own project. Build the vst then copy the plugin file to your DAW's plugin folder. The plugin file will have a .vst3 extension depending on the format you choose. Once the plugin is installed, you can use it in your DAW like any other audio effect plugin.

**Usage**

The plugin has two main audio effects: Phaser and Chorus. You can switch between these effects by selecting the desired effect from the ComboBox. Each effect has its own set of parameters that you can adjust to achieve the desired sound.

The Phaser effect creates a sweeping, phasing sound by shifting the phase of the audio signal. It has controls for the rate, depth, feedback, and mix of the effect.

The Chorus effect creates a thick, swirling sound by duplicating the audio signal and modulating the pitch and delay time of the duplicate signal. It has controls for the rate, depth, delay time, feedback, and mix of the effect.
